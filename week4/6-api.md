# What are APIs

* API stands for Applicatoin Programming Interface.

* APIs are objects/functions made available in programming languages to allow developers to create ambious applications.

* Ambious means non trivial applications:
  - build a 3d game using a game engine, the game engine provides an API to create complex shapes and handle physical interactions.
  - build augmented reality application using a augmented riality development kit, the kit provides an API to make the development of such kind of applications easier (look at ARkit).
  - Built an application using computer vision on top of google computer vision API, the API takes care of all the stuff related to computer vision (face recognition, image segmentation, etc).
