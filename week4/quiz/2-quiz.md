# Clean code, callbacks, json

## As long as the code is working it's considered clean code?

1. True
2. False

## Clean code is

1. Code that is well indented.
2. Code where variable names are short.
3. Code where function names are long.
4. Code where global variables are all around.

## Code readability means

1. Code is easy to understand.
2. Code is consistently indented.
3. Code where variables names describe their content.
4. Code where function names describe their actions.
5. Code where global variables are kept to a minimum.
6. Code where functions do one thing and do it well.
7. Code that is easy to debug.
8. Code that is easy to change and improve.
9. That make you want to kiss the person who wrote it (not really).

## A good function do one thing and one thing only?

1. True
2. False

## A good variable name make it even searchable?

1. True
2. False

## Synchronous code executes top to bottom?

1. True
2. False

## Asynchronous code executes top to bottom?

1. True
2. False

## A callback function is

1. A JavaScript function.
2. A function that is passed to another function as a parameter.
3. A JavaScript string.
4. A string that is passed to another function as a parameter.

## We use callbacks

1. To make functions eat other functions.
2. To execute asynchronous code in a preferred chronological order.
3. Because some built-in functions take other functions as parameters.

## the string representation of a JavaScript object is called

1. a json string representation
2. a json encoded representation
3. a serialized representation
4. a stringinshtiened representation
5. a stringified representation

## To generate a json JavaScript has

1. JSON.pase built-in method
2. toJSON built-in method
3. JSON.stringigy method

## To decode a json string into an object, JavaScript has

1. JSON.toObject built-in method
2. JSON.parse built-in method
3. Object.parseObject built-in method

## A json is  data format that is

1. Language indepedent.
2. Specific to JavaScript.
